# Large Language Models in Biology

This repo contains the "curriculum" and resources for a genomic and protein language model reading group at University of Colorado Boulder/Anschutz.


# Introductory Material
### Intro to language models and architecture 
* [How large language models work, a visual intro to transformers](https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M)
* [Attention in transformers, visually explained](https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc)
* [How might LLMs store facts](https://youtu.be/9-Jl0dxWQs8)
### Helpful Reviews
* [Genomic language models: opportunities and challenges](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11435v1)

# Some of the most popular LLM examples in Biology
### BERT (LLM) and Biology
* Main paper: [BERTology Meets Biology: Interpreting Attention in Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15222)‚Äù.
* [Video](https://youtu.be/q6Kyvy1zLwQ) (first 10-12 min are over bio, other the model)

### AlphaFold
* [Great 13min Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSy_yN9YBo)
* [Detailed blog that walks you through the algorithm](https://www.uvio.bio/alphafold-architecture/)
