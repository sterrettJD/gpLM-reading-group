# Curriculum for Fall 2025: Keeping up with the LLMs for a successful job search

This semester, we are focusing on learning about LLMs so that we can use them as they start taking over. LLMs take a LOT of power that we don't have access to as big companies are taking over instead. But how can we make sure we understand how to use them and keep up with them? That's what this semester is for!

All meetings are 10:30am-11:30am unless noted otherwise.

## Schedule
To be determined based on the topic ideas below!
